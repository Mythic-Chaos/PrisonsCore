This is the core for the prisons server on MythicChaos!

If you have access to this and you have been assigned a project to work on, then congratulations and thank you for working with us to make
this dream a reality! Just a few pointers I would like to make:
  - Make sure to follow standard naming conventions
  - Don't delete other code that is not relevant to your task/project and if you do make sure to document the change well
  - Make sure you use the PrisonPlayer instead of the Player object (it acts like the Player object the same)
  - Make sure to put semi-detailed commit notes
  
Also, please be aware that if there are comments in the code that you are working on, please make sure to read them and adhere to any
advice/requests they have detailed in them. 

Additionally, can we please make sure that we are cleaning up after ourselves, for example, if we are using a HashMap, please make sure we
clear the HashMap in a shutDown() method so that we eliminate the chance of memory leaks as much as possible. 

In addition, I, and all of us on the development team, would highly appreciate that when anyone commits and pushes code to the repo that we
have detailed commit logs so that we know exactly what has been done. This not only allows the team to be working together and know what is
going on, it also gives me, Bradley, the ability to track who is doing what so I can provide praise, or not, to those people who are putting
in a good amount of effort.
  
Current dependencies the plugin has are:
  - Vault
  
Happy Programming :D
