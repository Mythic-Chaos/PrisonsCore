This is the core for the prisons server on MythicChaos!

If you have access to this and you have been assigned a project to work on, then congratulations and thank you for working with us to make
this dream a reality! Just a few pointers I would like to make:
  - Make sure to follow standard naming conventions
  - Don't delete other code that is not relevant to your task/project and if you do make sure to document the change well
  - Make sure you use the PrisonPlayer instead of the Player object (it acts like the Player object the same)
  - Make sure to put semi-detailed commit notes
  
Current dependices the plugin has are:
  - Vault
